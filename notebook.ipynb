    "We assume that the present value of an option contract is recursively dependent on the expected future value of the option. Therefore, we employ the Bellman Equations to express the value of an option in terms of the expectation of fututre information. Let's first define the following:\n",
    "- $t$ the current time step.\n",
    "- $T$ expiry time step.\n",
    "- $S_t$ the contract's underliying price at time $t$\n",
    "- $K$ the strike price of our option.\n",
    "- $C(S_t)$ is a call option's exercise value given its current price $S_t$.\n",
    "- $P(S_t)$ is a put option's exercise value given its current price $S_t$.\n",
    "- $V_C(S_t)$ is the call options expected value when its underlying asset is valued at $S_t$.\n",
