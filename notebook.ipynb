    "In this project we approach theoretical option pricing as a dynamic programming problem in which at each time step we have information $s_t \\in \\mathcal{S}$ such as the underlying price, time till expiry, interest rates, etc. We also have a set of actions we can take at each time step $a \\in \\mathcal{A}$ such as early exercise, hedging adjustment, taking no action, etc. We also have functions defining the cost/reward of taking an action $C(s_t, a_t)$ and probabilty of transitioning from one state to another $P(s_{t + dt} ~|~ s_t, a_t)$ typically independent of $a_t$ and corresponds to price movements of the underlying. Our goal therefore is to find $V^*(s_t)$ which denotes the theoretical value of an option under the assumtion that the holder of the contract takes the most optional actions during the lifetime of the contract. By the Bellman Optimality Principle, $V^*(s_t)$ can be recursively defined as:\n",

    "- $\\delta$ is the mean jump size,\n",
    "- $v_t$ denotes the stochastic volatility process,\n",
    "- $\\kappa$ is the mean-reversion rate of volatility,\n",
    "- $\\theta$ is the long-term average volatility,\n",
    "- $\\sigma_v$ is the volatility of volatility,\n",
    "- $dW_t$ and $dZ_t$ are Wiener processes for the stock price and volatility, respectively,\n",
    "- $dN_t$ is a Poisson process increment for jumps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bates model offers a comprehensive framework for options pricing and risk management in financial markets, accommodating both continuous and discontinuous movements in asset prices. Its integration of stochastic volatility allows for a more realistic portrayal of market behavior, crucial for accurate pricing and hedging strategies in derivatives markets."

Therefore at each time step we have the choice of exercising and recieving a payoff of $\\max\\{0, S - K\\}$ or not exercising. If we dont exercise, our underlying stock moves to a new price $S_{t + 1}$ with probability $P(S_{t + 1} ~|~ S_t)$ and we have a new problem of whether or not we should exercise. This recursive relationship can be modeled with the following dynamic programm\n",
